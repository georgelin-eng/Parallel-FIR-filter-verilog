### Sample Data

If a real time continuous signal is made digital it might look something like this:

0.000232343212
0.016565655656
0.056235454322
0.046532556566

This input signal is called x[n]. 

Is there a reason that this can't be made into a iterative combinational circuit?

Using registers and synchronizing computations and synchronizing computations to a clock cycle might be easier
